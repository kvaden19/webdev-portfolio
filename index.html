            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Kelly, a software developer based in Pittsburgh, PA. 
            </p>
            <p>I began my career as a mechanical engineer. As I worked on problems in the energy industry, I realized how much we depended on robust, user-friendly 
                software and I became interested in designing those systems myself. I have experience with Python and SQL through my engineering roles, and I'm excited
                to learning more of the web development stack through Rutgers University's Full Stack program. 
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I can usually be found playing my bass guitar, running, or hanging out with my wife Emily and our dogs.
            </p>

                    <h4>Horiseon Accessibility Refactor</h4>
                    <a href="https://kvaden19.github.io/rutgers-hw-1-code-refactor/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="assets/images/horiseon-semantic.png" alt="A snippet of code showing semantic HTML and images with alt attributes"/> 
                    </a>
                    <p>In this project I overhauled an existing website's HTML and CSS to improve accessibility. This work included replacing non-semantic HTML elements
                        with semantic elements, refactoring elements to follow a logical structure, and adding "alt" attributes to all images. This refactor will deliver 
                        a much better user experience for anyone accessing the site with a screen reader. It should also improve the site's search engine results, which 
                        is crucial since the company is a digital marketing firm offering SEO.
