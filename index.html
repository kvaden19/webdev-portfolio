            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Kelly, a software developer based in Pittsburgh, PA. </p>
            <p>I'm an aspiring software developer with a background in engineering and data analysis. I'm currently working on a certificate in full stack development from Rutgers University, with newly developed skills in JavaScript and the MERN Stack to add to my existing knowledge of SQL Server and Python.</p>

            <p>A lifelong learner, I taught myself SQL to streamline data-gathering tasks for my engineering team. I contributed to building an energy efficiency recommendations engine in Python. My communication and collaboration skills are sharply honed from ten years working as an engineer and project manager.</p>
            
            <p>As a future full-stack or back-end developer, I’m excited to bring data-driven insights to end-users for a fast-paced and innovative company.</p>

            <p>When I'm not coding, I can usually be found playing my bass guitar, running, or hanging out with my wife Emily and our dogs.

                    <p>Worked with a small group to create a meal planner app, which allows the user to choose meals from a large library and view their weekly plan. My contribution was to design the database schema and models using Sequelize ORM and seed the database through a third-party API.

                    <p>Worked with a small group to create an online hub for European Football information, including upcoming games and team stats. This was a great first experience collaborating with other developers and using GitHub for pull requests, code reviews, and resolving conflicts. My contribution was to use JavaScript’s Fetch API and a third-party API to show the user stats on upcoming matches.

                    <p>A simple weather dashboard that allows a user to look up current and future weather conditions based on city name. The user's last ten searches will persist in local storage and be shown on the page. The app is built with HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap and Font Awesome for layout and icons.
