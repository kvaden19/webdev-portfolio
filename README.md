# Web Development Portfolio

## Description 

This is a simple, one-page website to house my eventual web development portfolio. For this project, I built the page from scratch using HTML and CSS. I felt it was important to build the page from the ground up, without the use of CSS templates. This way, the page itself is a portfolio piece showing my front-end abilities. 


## Usage 

The portfolio page can be viewed here:
https://kvaden19.github.io/webdev-portfolio/

The page contains my name, photo, a short About Me section, several portfolio pieces, and my contact information. It is meant to be the first piece of content a potential employer or collaborator might see about me. Using this page they can see a snapshot of my recent projects, follow links to GitHub if they'd like to dive into the details,
and/or contact me via email, GitHub, or LinkedIn.

## Lessons Learned 

This project forced me to wrap my head around CSS layout, box-model, Flexbox, and media queries in a way that's just not possible with simple class exercises.
My CSS isn't perfect, but I now feel much more comfortable creating or tweaking layouts.

I also confirmed my suspicion that I'm a back-end developer at heart and will probably be using and adapting CSS templates when possible. :)

## Future Work

    * Can CSS be simplied? The media query for mobile is doing a lot of work
    * My profile photo / background image could flow into each other better 
    * On mobile, the profile photo with half border needs to be centered
    * As I create more portfolio-ready pieces, they will replace the placholder text and doggos (sorry Bruce!)
